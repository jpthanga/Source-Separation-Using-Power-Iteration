## Source-Separation-Using-Power-Iteration
Toy Example of Source Sepration of two Notes using Eigen Decomposition

The repository contains code used for a toy example to show that in naive conditions, source separation is possible with just eigen decommposition and using eigen vectors as the basis vectors.

The power iteration function and all other functions required are coded from scratch and no library functions are used.

Input - matrix representation of source containing both signals
Output - Separated signals
